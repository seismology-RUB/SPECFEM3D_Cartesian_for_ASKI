    abstract = {{In many fields using empirical areal data there arises a need for interpolating from irregularly-spaced data to produce a continuous surface. These irregularly-spaced locations, hence referred to as  ” data points,” may have diverse meanings: in meterology, weather observation stations; in geography, surveyed locations; in city and regional planning, centers of data-collection zones; in biology, observation locations. It is assumed that a unique number (such as rainfall in meteorology, or altitude in geography) is associated with each data point.In order to display these data in some type of contour map or perspective view, to compare them with data for the same region based on other data points, or to analyze them for extremes, gradients, or other purposes, it is extremely useful, if not essential, to define a continuous function fitting the given values exactly. Interpolated values over a fine grid may then be evaluated. In using such a function it is assumed that the original data are without error, or that compensation for error will be made after interpolation.}},
